Add:
-button to completely remove the brain outline
-button to switch focus between brain and brain + spinal cord

Maybe add:
-button to highlight selected feature, possibly have a blinking outline (change fill color over and over?)


Fix:
X-find a way to reset user's viewport to top of page each time they navigate to different link
    ***Perhaps make a function in each component that moves the viewport up to the top when they load (besides Navbar)

    
-figure out how to keep the search glass within the search bar container
-figure out how to make a dropdown animation for the burger menu
