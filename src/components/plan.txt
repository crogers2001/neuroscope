Add:
-button to completely remove the brain outline
-button to switch focus between brain and brain + spinal cord

Maybe add:
-button to highlight selected feature, possibly have a blinking outline (change fill color over and over?)


Fix:
-Brain Explorer model needs to be based on the users screen width instead of a hardcoded number

-onClick, onBlur, and onFocus are getting messed up because there are several things being rendered at one time in the same place.
    Perhaps I need to completely unrender everything beneath something when it is clicked to avoid this.
    Another fix would be to figure out the specifics of click events so I can specify exactly 
 ***SOLVE: It seems that the on____ events are only getting messed up when I click off the mobile device emulator. Perhaps I can
            simply ignore it unless it is a problem in production.
